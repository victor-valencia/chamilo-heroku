Google Meet plugin
============================
This plugin allows you to have videoconference rooms in each course using Google Meet.
This is only a light integration, meaning you will still need to go to Google Meet and
have a Google account in order to create a meeting *and* students will need to be
connected to their Google account to connect. However, we believe there is still value
in making this plugin available for our community at large.
